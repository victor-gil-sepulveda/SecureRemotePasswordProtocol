#Secure Remote Password Protocol

This is a project I started in early 2010 for an Apache-based web app. It used Python in the back-end and Javascript in the front-end. Being just a proof of concept, the code was not thoroughly tested. By definition, the initial commit is then legacy code, and it is full of technical debt.  

This is a new attempt to refactor it, adding a decent test coverage, and a C++11 + CUDA version.
